use crate::range::{Gain, Range};

/// Calibration table: `(raw Hann-weighted RMS in LSB, amps on the reference
/// ammeter)`, ascending by LSB. Interpolated piecewise-linearly.
///
/// The scored quantity is agreement with the reference ammeter, not absolute
/// accuracy -- 1(1) is "误差 ... 相对于标定电流表读数". So any error a single
/// scale factor can absorb is already free, and what is left after fitting is
/// only what a straight line *cannot* absorb: curvature across the 20:1 range.
/// The CT is the suspect -- core permeability falls at low flux, so its ratio
/// error is worst at 0.1 A, exactly where 0.5% is 0.5 mA. A two-point fit
/// cannot follow that; a table can, and it needs no model of the mechanism.
///
/// Also why nothing here should "correct" toward theory: if the reference
/// instrument reads 2% low, matching it scores full marks and being right
/// scores zero. Fit what the reference says, verbatim.
///
/// One table per range, rather than one shared table plus a gain factor.
/// The autoranger makes the range part of the measurement, and the ladder's
/// real step ratios are not the nominal 2/4/8/16/32 -- their deviation is the
/// same order as the whole 0.5% budget. A per-range table absorbs that ratio
/// error, the range's own DC behaviour, and the CT curvature above, all in one
/// set of bench readings, with no separate gain-trim constant to measure or
/// to get wrong.
///
/// TO FILL: set the load to each current, read the reference ammeter and the
/// OLED's `rms` line together, and enter the pair *in the table for the gain
/// the OLED is showing*. Denser at the bottom -- that is where both the
/// curvature and the relative sensitivity are worst.
///
/// Only fill the span each step actually sees. With FILL_TARGET_PCT the
/// autoranger picks x32 at 0.1 A and drops toward x4 near 2 A, so most steps
/// only need the few hundred mA around their own band, plus enough overlap
/// past each re-range threshold that neighbouring tables agree where they
/// meet -- a disagreement there shows up as a step in the reading every time
/// the range changes. The step in use at 2 A additionally needs a point past
/// 2 A, so the over-limit alarm region is interpolated rather than
/// extrapolated.
/// `CAL_X1` is the `Direct` range, and on this front end it is the range the
/// bench actually runs in: every reading below came off the OLED showing `x1`.
///
/// Two gaps this span does not cover. The top point is 2.03 A, so the `> 2 A`
/// alarm region 2(3) has to watch is extrapolated off the last segment rather
/// than interpolated -- it wants a point past 2 A. And 0.191 A to 0.530 A is
/// one segment carrying most of the decade where the CT's ratio error is
/// worst, which is the opposite of the "denser at the bottom" above.
